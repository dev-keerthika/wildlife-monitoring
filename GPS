GPS collars on animals track their location.
GSM modules in these collars transmit location and health data.
Drones and satellites monitor the larger environment and track animal movement over large areas.
Sensors collect data on the animalâ€™s health, which can be analyzed remotely.
GIS and other software are used to store, analyze, and visualize this data to track patterns and assist in conservation efforts.
